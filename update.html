        <h1>Bookmark Dial has changed!</h1>
        <p>
            Firefox has been working on a new extension API for a while which
            is to replace all other existing APIs in Firefox 57. Migrating
            Bookmark Dial to the new API required some changes - most notably:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Homepage and new tab page are replaced by Bookmark Dial now
                    as there is no way to make either optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updates outside of Bookmark Dial are now reflected
                    immediately which allowed me to remove custom dialogues.
                    You can use the built-in keyboard shortcuts, menu entries
                    and buttons for bookmark handling now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thumbnails cannot be generated in the background anymore.
                    Instead thumbnails are generated from a snapshot of the
                    visible area of a webpage that is taken the first time a
                    bookmark from the configured bookmark folder is open in the
                    currently active tab. There is also a button in the popup
                    opened from the toolbar icon that allows you to create a
                    new snapshot (disabled for unknown URLs). The latter allows
                    you to capture the part of a webpage that you want as you
                    can scroll and resize the window before taking the
                    snapshot. Overall you have more control over thumbnail
                    generation but you loose some convenience.
                </li>
            </ul>
