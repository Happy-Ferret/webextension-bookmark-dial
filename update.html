        <h1>Bookmark Dial has changed!</h1>
        <p>
            Firefox has been working on a new extension API for while which is
            to replace all other existing APIs in Firefox 57. Migrating
            Bookmark Dial to the new API required some changes - most notably:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Homepage and new tab page are replaced by Bookmark Dial now
                    as there is no way to make either optional.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Updates outside of Bookmark Dial are now reflected
                    immediately which allowed me to remove custom dialogues.
                    You can use the built-in keyboard shortcuts, menu entries
                    and buttons now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thumbnails cannot be generated in the background anymore.
                    Instead a snapshot is taken the first time a bookmark is
                    opened (or when it is open in the active tab when adding
                    it). There is also a page action to replace the existing
                    thumbnail with the snapshot of the currently open bookmark.
                    The latter gives you more control over the thumbnail as it
                    allows you to size the window and to scroll.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </body>
