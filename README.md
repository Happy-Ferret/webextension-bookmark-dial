Bookmark dial
=============

Displays the contents of a bookmark folder including a thumbnail when you start
the browser and open a new tab (instead of frequently visited sites,
suggestions and sponsored links). Similar extensions call this speed dial. In
most cases they do not use bookmarks and/or require you to manually tweak
settings to change the layout of the thumbnails.

Bookmark Dial arranges and sizes (up to a maximum size) the thumbnails to be as
big as possible by default. As a bookmark folder is used, sync comes with your
browser and you can use the usual keyboard shortcuts, menu entries and buttons
to add, edit and delete dial items.
