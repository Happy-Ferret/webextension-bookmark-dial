# firefox-bookmark-dial
Display the contents of a bookmark folder as thumbnails with title everytime
the user opens Firefox or a new tab.

Most options are accessible through the context menu(see screenshots for more
information). You can also set a custom css file in the add-on's preferences to
change the style. Note that it will replace, not complement the default one so
you should use
https://github.com/sblask/firefox-bookmark-dial/blob/master/data/bookmark_dial.css
as a starting point.

Adding or changing bookmarks outside the new tab page will not automatically
update open tabs, but opening new ones or refreshing a tab will.
